# Hover-Activated Rotating Wheel

This project demonstrates a colorful rotating wheel animation that activates when the user hovers over it. The wheel is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a vibrant multi-color design with smooth animations.

## Features
- **Colorful Design**: The wheel displays multiple vibrant colors using a `conic-gradient`.
- **Hover Activation**: The wheel starts spinning only when the user hovers over it.
- **Smooth Animation**: Includes smooth start and stop effects for the rotation.
- **Responsive Layout**: The wheel is centered and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Demo
Hover over the wheel to see it spin. Move the cursor away to stop the animation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling, gradients, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For logging and future interactivity (though not required for the basic functionality).



## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mastermind730/SoarX_Submission.git
   
## How It Works
- The wheel is styled using conic-gradient for the multi-color appearance.
- The animation is triggered using the hover CSS pseudo-class.
- The @keyframes rule defines a continuous rotation effect, which is applied only on hover.
- 
## Customization
- **Wheel Size**: Adjust the width and height properties in the CSS file to resize the wheel.
- **Animation Speed**: Modify the animation duration (e.g., 3s to 2s for faster rotation).
  **Colors**: Update the conic-gradient colors to customize the look of the wheel.
